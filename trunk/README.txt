Thank you for choosing SnowCMS! Beware that when you use
SnowCMS that you could be using unstable code...

So, we highly recommend you DO NOT use SnowCMS that has
been download from a nightly or SVN on a public site, also
we will NOT provide update packages from one SVN revision
to another, however you can of course install SnowCMS for
you to test out and see what it is like.

=========================================================

Installation:

1) Of course, you have done this, downloaded it ;)
2) Upload it to your server or where ever you want to 
install it
3) Access the directory of where install.php is, as it will
automatically redirect you to the install.php file
4) Input your MySQL database details, and hit continue
5) If it succeeded, proceed to give your details, like
directory paths (though they should be put in correctly by
default, just check to make sure) and your administrative
account details, hit continue
6) After that, it should successfully install, and you can
login, however, don't forget to delete the install.php file!
