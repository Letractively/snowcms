   IMPORTANT: If you're editing this file in the output directory of one of
   your projects, your changes will be overwritten the next time you run
   Natural Docs.  Instead, copy this file to your project directory, make your
   changes, and you can use it with -s.  Even better would be to make a CSS
   file in your project directory with only your changes, which you can then
   use with -s [original style] [your changes].

   On the other hand, if you're editing this file in the Natural Docs styles
   directory, the changes will automatically be applied to all your projects
   that use this style the next time Natural Docs is run on them.
