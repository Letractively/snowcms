The docs are generated through NaturalDocs, using the NaturalDocs syntax.

A syntax converter thingy is at preprocess.py, run with python preprocess.py _FILE_NAME_ Code editing is quite important

To run naturaldocs:
antimatter15@antimatter15-desktop:~/Desktop/naturaldocs$ ./NaturalDocs -i ../snowcms/ -o HTML ../snowcms/docs/ -p ../snowcms/docs/
